#  Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback

## 📌 Goal  
To identify sentiment patterns in customer feedback and uncover drivers of positive and negative experiences.

## 🔎 Description  
This project applies text mining and sentiment analysis techniques to a dataset of user-generated comments collected via a digital video platform. The workflow includes data cleaning, tokenization, sentiment scoring using Vietnamese NLP models, and exploratory data analysis to identify trends across time, content types, and tags.

Key analyses include:
- Most frequent positive/negative words by tag and content
- Time trends of sentiment distribution
- Identification of tags with unusually high/low sentiment scores
- Highlighting niche vs. mass content performance in relation to user sentiment

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, PhoBERT (Vietnamese NLP)  
- **Power BI**: interactive visualization of sentiment results  
- **GitHub**: Documentation and version control

## 🎯 Key Insights  
- Although the **"vod"** tag generated the highest number of comments overall, its positive sentiment rate (37.71%) was lower than that of smaller tags, suggesting quantity does not necessarily correlate with satisfaction.  
- The **average number of comments per video** was significantly higher for mass-market tags (e.g., "vod", "event") compared to niche tags like "phim-le" or "anime", reflecting broader but less sentimentally positive engagement.  
- Over time, the **overall volume of comments has fluctuated**, peaking in certain years like 2017 and 2021, indicating potential seasonal content strategies or external factors driving viewer engagement.
